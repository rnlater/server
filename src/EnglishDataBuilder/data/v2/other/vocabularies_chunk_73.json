The best-known British writers of detective stories include  Arthur Conan Doyle ,  Agatha Christie  and Ruth Rendell. The older type of British detective story is often set in a large country house, and typically includes the discovery of a murder at the beginning, a small group of characters who are all suspected of having committed the murder, and a surprising solution at the end. In the US, detective stories more often involve the police or the adventures of a 'private eye'  (= private detective) , and are often more violent and realistic. Famous US writers of such stories include  Dashiell Hammett ,  Raymond Chandler  and Elmore Leonard. Detective stories are also known as 'detective fiction' or 'crime fiction' and informally as '  whodunnits ' (or 'whodunits').",
